            Yin yang fried rice (also transliterated as yuenyeung fried rice ) 
            is a rice dish from Hong Kong, consisting of a plate of rice with 
            béchamel sauce and tomato sauce.

            The name "yuenyeung", which refers to mandarin ducks, is a symbol of conjugal
            love in Chinese culture, as the birds usually appear in pairs and the male 
            and female look very different.[2] This same connotation of a "pair" of two 
            unlike items is used to name this rice. Due to the meaning of love, this dish 
            often appears in the wedding dinner.
